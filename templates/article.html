    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The project Deep Learning Based Ship Detection from Multi-Modal Satellite photos intends
to develop a deep learning-based system for autonomously identifying ships in satellite
photos. A sizable collection of multi-modal satellite images, including images from several
sensors and wavelengths, will be used to train the system. The system will be able to identify
ships in a variety of circumstances and situations by utilizing deep learning algorithms, which
will be an improvement over current ship detection techniques. The system will be judged
based on how well it can precisely and consistently spot ships in satellite photos, and its
potential uses will be investigated.</p>

    <h2>The Model</h2>
        <p>Our model consists of several convolutional layers followed by fully
            connected layers. The convolutional layers are responsible for extracting
            features from the input image, while the fully connected layers perform the
            actual classification.
            The model is defined using PyTorch's nn.Module class.</p>

        <h2>Comparison of PyTorch and TensorFlow Models</h2>

    <h4>PyTorch Model:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Uses Batch Normalization layers.</li>
        <li>Achieves a test accuracy of 99.25% after early stopping at 37 epochs.</li>
        <li>Final validation loss is 0.3358.</li>
    </ul>

        <h4>TensorFlow Model:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Does not use Batch Normalization layers.</li>
        <li>Achieves a test accuracy of 99.12% after early stopping at 25 epochs.</li>
        <li>Final validation loss is 0.1273.</li>

    <h2>What Is Next</h2>
        <p>We are going to use two segmentation model for categorization of shi. Firstly DINOv2 and
the other SAM(Segment of Anything) but we are working on it.</p>
